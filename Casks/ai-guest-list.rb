  caveats <<~EOS
    AI Guest List is not signed or notarized, so macOS Gatekeeper blocks the first
    launch. Pick one of these:

    Easiest — clear the quarantine attribute after installing:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/AI Guest List.app"

    Or approve it in Gatekeeper:
      - macOS 15 (Sequoia) and newer: open the app once and dismiss the warning,
        then go to System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll down, and click
        "Open Anyway". (Right-click > Open no longer bypasses Gatekeeper on 15+.)
      - macOS 14 and earlier: right-click the app in /Applications and choose
        Open, then Open again.
